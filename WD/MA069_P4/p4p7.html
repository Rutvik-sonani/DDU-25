    <pre><b><h4>The ASP Technology</h4></b>
        ASP and ASP.NET are server side technologies.
        Both technologies enable computer code to be executed by an Internet server.    
        When a browser requests an ASP or ASP.NET file, the ASP engine reads the file, executes any code in the file, and returns the result to the browser.
            Classic ASP - Active Server Pages
            ASP (aka Classic ASP) was introduced in 1998 as Microsoft's first server side scripting language.
            Classic ASP pages have the file extension .asp and are normally written in VBScript.
        <b>ASP.NET</b>
            ASP.NET was released in 2002 as a successor to Classic ASP.
            ASP.NET pages have the extension .aspx and are normally written in C# (C sharp).
            ASP.NET 4.6 is the latest official version of ASP.NET.
            ASP.NET 5 was expected to be an important redesign of ASP.NET.
            However, the development of ASP.NET 5 was stopped in favor of ASP.NET Core.
        <b><h3>ASP.NET Web Pages</h3></b>
        ASP.NET Web Pages is an SPA application model (Single Page Application).
        The SPA model is quite similar to PHP and Classic ASP.
        ASP.NET Web Pages is being merged into the new ASP.NET Core.</pre>

        CSS is a style sheet or presentational language that is used to layout, format, and 
        style documents that are written in HTML to make them look beautiful. CSS is generally used with
        HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. You can use CSS to change the color,

        <pre><b><h4>VBScript</h4></b>
        VBScript stands for Visual Basic Scripting that forms a subset of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). 
        VBA is a product of Microsoft which is included NOT only in other Microsoft products such as MS Project 
        and MS Office but also in Third Party tools such as AUTO CAD.
        Features of VBScript
            VBScript is a lightweight scripting language, which has a lightning fast interpreter.
            VBScript, for the most part, is case insensitive. It has a very simple syntax, easy to learn and to implement.
            Unlike C++ or Java, VBScript is an object-based scripting language and NOT an Object-Oriented Programming language.
            It uses Component Object Model (COM) in order to access the elements of the environment in which it is executing.
        VBscript – Version History and Uses
            VBScript was introduced by Microsoft way back in 1996 and its first version was 1.0. The current stable version of VBScript is 5.8, which is available as part of IE8 or Windows 7.
            The VBScript usage areas are aplenty and not restricted to the below list.
            VBScript is used as a scripting language in one of the popular Automation testing tools – Quick Test 
            Professional abbreviated as QTP
            VBScript is used for Client side scripting in Microsoft Internet Explorer.</pre>
